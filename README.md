# Pridicting Car Prices #

This project uses K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to predict car prices.

Includes:
* Initial analysis and data cleaning 
* Data normalisation to prepare for ML
* Trying Different Hyperparameters and different features to find the most optimal
* Conclusion of which features and hyperparameters present with the smallest error i.e. the best to use as a model to predict prices
